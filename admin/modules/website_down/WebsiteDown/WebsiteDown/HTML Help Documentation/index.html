		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This theme is a fixed layout with two sections. All of the information within the main content is nested within a div with an id of "page-container". Two of the sections are nested within an unordered list with an id of "page". Here is the general structure.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/htmlstructure.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
		
		<p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements in one of these columns, you would do the following:</p>

<pre>	#page a {
		color: #someColor;
	} 
</pre>

		<p>If you find that your new style is not overriding, it is most likely because of a specificity problem. Scroll down in your CSS file and make sure that there isn't a similar style that has more weight.</p>

		<p>I.E.</p>

<pre>	#wrapper #page a {
		color: #someColor;
	}
</pre>

		<p>So, to ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p> 

		<hr>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Four CSS files are used in this theme. The first one is a generic reset file. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work round this. This file also contains some general styling, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, etc. Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file.</p> 
		
		<p>ie.css and ie8.css are for fixing the problems that are caused by some earlier versions of Internet Explorer. </p> 

		<p>The fourth file (blue.css, green.css, red.css, yellow.css, purple.css) contains all of the specific stylings for the page. The file is separated into sections using:</p>  

<pre>	/* === Layout === */

	some code

	/* === Countdown === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Contact Form === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Validation === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Newsletter === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Social === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === Twitter === */
	
	some code
	
	etc, etc. 
</pre>
		
		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p> 
<hr>
		<p>If you would like to change the color scheme of the theme with the existing alternatives, you just have to change the name of the .css file under style.css. 
		
		<pre>@import "style/css/green.css";</pre>
		
		<p>The example above uses green color scheme. If you would like to use blue, you should replace the code with:</p>
		
		<pre>@import "style/css/blue.css";</pre>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports six Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>jCarousel</li>
			<li>Countdown</li>
			<li>Twitter</li>
			<li>Sliding Labels</li>
			<li>jQuery Inline Validation</li>
			
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>

			<li>jCarousel is used for the transition between sections. You can learn more about the script and other usage tips from <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">here</a>.</li>
			
			<li>jQuery Countdown is used for the countdown on first section. To change the time you should replace the following (YYYY, MM, DD) under custom.js:
			
			<pre>j(function () {

		var newYear = new Date(); 
    	newYear = new Date(YYYY, MM - 1, DD);
    	j('.defaultCountdown').countdown({until: newYear}); 
  
		});  </pre>
		
		For further usage tips of the script you can get help from <a href="http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html">here</a>
		
			</li>
			<li>Twitter is used for displaying last twitter message on the site. To be able to display your own twitter messages you should replace the following under custom.js 
			
			<pre> getTwitters('twitter', {
        id: 'YOUR TWITTER ID', 
        count: 1, 
        enableLinks: true, 
        ignoreReplies: false,
        template: '<span class="twitterPrefix"><span class="twitterStatus">%text%</span> <em class="twitterTime"><a href="http://twitter.com/%user_screen_name%/statuses/%id%">- %time%</a></em>',
        newwindow: true
    });</pre>
    	For further usage tips of the script you can get help from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twitterjs/">here</a>
    
			</li>
			
			<li>Sliding Labels were used in the contact form to slide the labels (name, email, message). You can learn more about the script <a href="http://www.csskarma.com/blog/sliding-labels-v2">here</a></li>
			
			<li>jQuery inline validation is used for form validation which is used in the contact form on contact section. For further usage tips of the script you can get help from <a href="http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/">here</a></li>

		<h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>D) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've included two psds with this theme:</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>The First Section</li>
				<li>The Second Section</li>
			</ol>
		
		<p>The psd files were creating using 960.gs grid system. They are labeled, layered, grouped and easily editable. If you make any adjustments, slicing will be easy.</p> 
		
		<hr>
		
		
		<h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've used the following images, icons or other files as listed.
		
		<ul>
			<li>Social icons: http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/</li>
			<li>Twitter bird: http://www.mirkku.com/tweet/</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="php"><strong>C) PHP / CONTACT and SUBSCRIPTION</strong> - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>To receive the emails that are sent via contact form, you must do the following: 
            	<ul>
                	<li>Open the contact.php under the HTML theme folder (fleepy) that you previously uploaded.</li>
                    <li>On 11th line you will see the following:
                    
                    <pre>$EmailTo = "yourname@domain.com";</pre>
                    
                    Replace the quoted sample address with your email address.
                    </li>
                    <li>After the changes save the document.</li>
                    
                   
         
                </ul></li>
                 <li>Do the same with subscribe.php to receive the email addresses of the subscribers.</li>
            </ul>
         <hr>
		
		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme.
